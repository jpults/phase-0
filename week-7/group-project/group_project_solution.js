// As a user, I want to have a function that tells me the sum of a group of numbers, adding each number in the group To find the SUM. For each number, I add that number to my sum, starting at 0.
// I might have to start by counting how many numbers I had, so I knew when to stop.


// 2

// As a user, I want to add all the numbers in a group of numbers together, then divide them by the number of numbers to find the AVERAGE.  I'd start by counting how many numbers I wanted to "average" 
// Then, for each number, I would add that number to an initial value of 0 to find the SUM. Just like I did before. Finally, I would take the sum and divide it by the # of numbers I had. 


// 3 

// As a user, I want to find the middle number in order of a group of numbers, or the MEDIAN.  For example, if I had 1, 2 , and 3, I would want to find 3. The numbers are already in order.
// Since the numbers are already in order, if I have an odd # of numbers, then I can the # of numbers by 2, rounding up if necessary, and that would be the position of the median. 
// If I have an even # of numbers, I could divide the # of numbers by 2, then take the number at that position AND the number right after it, and find the AVERAGE of those two. I can find the average the same way I did before.
