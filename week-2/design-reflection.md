1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
    #### One 
    Information Gathering. Determine why you are building the site, what it needs to accomplish, and how it will do it.
    #### Two
    Planning. Create a site map that details the basic layout and content of the site. It will also include needed systems and features of the site.
    #### Three 
    Design. Draw out the specific layout of the site. This may take several drafts or mockups. Decide the color schemes, logos, and the overall look of the site.
    #### Four
    Development. Take the design and start to implement it in code. This is made easier by making a shell, or base layout for the pages on the site.  
    #### Five
    Testing and Delivery. Make sure your site works on a variety of devices and that there are as few technical issues as possible.  Make sure it fits into good style guidelines. Then you can show it to the world or deliver it to the client.
    #### Six
    Maintenance. Make sure the site keeps working and add any new features or content.  
2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature? 

    The site will be a showcase of my skills as a developer and a resume. It might have projects i've worked on, contact info, past employers, and other things that are for fun.
3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

Potential employers would be looking to see examples of things I have done in the past, and where I have worked/studied.  In addition to these things, the site itself might serve as an example of technical know-how.
4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action should be looking at the portfolio. Then, if they don't already have my resume, they can find it there.
5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

They should understand the way that humans in general tend to process information, especially visible info.  They should be able to look at user surveys and determine what is working about a design and what is not.
6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

It is designing by primarily focusing on the ease of use and accessibility for the user.  The more comfortable and pleasant your design is, the more likely it will be used again. It will stand out among other, harder to use sites. 
7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
