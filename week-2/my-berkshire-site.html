   - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
   
   It was quite interesting seeing it come together so quickly.  It makes me excited for what can be done in the future.
   
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  It was somewhat confusing, but I can see why it will be helpful when we learn more about how a webpage comes together.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  
  I think we did alright for the most part, but we may have slipped up a bit in order to get the page to look right.
  
- What seems good and bad about HTML?

  The good part was that it is very clear cut with the descriptions of most of the tags. <center> for example just centers the text. The bad news is that it can get very cluttered and confusing with multiple tags for one bit of text, as well as the fact that you have to remember to close them all the right way.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

  I always try to close the tags I make immediately, so that I can't forget later.  It saves on headaches. I have also been making flashcards for some of the more complicated tags.
