1. How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

The dev tools will dynamically change your page based on what changes you make to the css elements. When you click on an element, you can see a list of Css properties. You can turn them off and on as well as add new ones, to quickly see what would happen with certain changes without changing your original css code.

2. How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can change the height and width properties, or you can squeeze elements within margins if they are not in the absolute position. 
3. What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute: The element will not move no matter what, and will follow the user if they scroll around the page. The size will stay the same as well.

Fixed: The element will stay in the same position on the page, not effected by other elements. It will not "follow" around the page however.

Relative: Can be adjusted by the top, left, right and bottom properties. Position is of course relative to the parent elements.

Static: The default position. Not affected by directional margins. It will follow the rest of the page normally.
4. What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

A border is simply a visible line around the element that can be of varying sizes.  A margin is how far from the sides of the page and other elements the element is.  Padding, however is how much space is between the edge of the element and the text.
5. What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

This challenge was fun but frustrating. I like to play around with systems as part of my learning, and we had plenty of opportunity for that. However, my partner and I encountered multiple situations where we appeared to be doing the exact same thing, but got different results.  We still aren't sure what happened. Css is complicated and it seems like there is a lot more I need to learn about how elements interact when building a page before I'll be comfortable with it.
